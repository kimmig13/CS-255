# CS-255

#Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client for this project was DriverPass.  They were looking to develop a system that would allow clients to take classes online to study for taking a driving test.  Being able to actually schedule driving appointments online with instructors was something else they were looking to incorporate into this program.

#What did you do particularly well?
I believe that I did pretty well in designing the UML charts and diagrams through Lucidcchart.  

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would go back and revisit the Systems design document.  I was rushed while doing it and feel I could have probably done better with it.

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I thought about what neededd to be done, step-by-step, and implemented that into the system design.  Users needs need to be considered when designing because they are ultimately the ones who will be using it the most and can make a program prosper or fail.

#How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I like to use Psuedocode when starting to develop software.  That process lays out exactly what needs to be done and the different branches that each answer could take.  I did, however, like the business requirements layout that we did for this client and may utilize it for future projects.
